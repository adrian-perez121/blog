# Thoughts/Impressions

This is my first time using a framework to use a web app and oh my goodness can I say it
be overwhelming. However it was interesting to see all the bits and pieces work together...

+ To me, routes seem to be a conversational tool between the front end
and the back end. Resources is a powerful method and the fact you can nest stuff to show a hierarchy
of models
+ The methods behind models is something I am still getting used to right now
from my persective it seems like a method pops out the blue and it just works but I know there's more to it
+ Controllers are also something I am still getting used and how they interact with the views. I am going to need more
practice.
+ As for views, they are extremely barebones in this app but things are going to get interesting
once styling is added to the mix.

Well rails, this is only the beginning!
